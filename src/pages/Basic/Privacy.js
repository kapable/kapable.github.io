      <h4>COOKIES</h4>
      K-TEST uses cookies to: store visitors’ preferences; record user-specific
      information on what pages users access or visit; ensure that visitors are
      not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; or customize our content based on
      visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We

      media, advertising and analytics partners. This section explains what
      cookies are, how we use Cookies and similar technologies on our Website
      and what you can do to manage how Cookies are used.
      <h5>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h5>A cookie is a small text file which is sent to
      your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”)
      by the web server so that a website can remember some information about
      your browsing activity on the Website. The Cookie will collect information
      relating to your use of the Website, information about your device such as
      the device’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you
      arrived at our Website via a link from third party site, the URL of the
      linking page. In addition to Cookies, the Website may use web beacons. Web
      beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed
      the Website and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. We may employ
      web beacons to facilitate Website administration and navigation, to track
      the actions of users of the Website, to compile aggregate statistics about
      Website usage and response rates, and to provide an enhanced online
      experience for visitors to the Website. We may also include web beacons in
      HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail
      messages were opened. A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1
      x 1 pixel in size with no color. A web beacon can also be known as a web

      <i>Essential:</i> These are Cookies which are essential for the running of
      our Website. Without these Cookies, parts of our Website would not
      function. These Cookies do not track where you have been on the internet
      and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing
      purposes. Examples of how we may use essential Cookies include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so that website
          numbers can be analyzed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Functional: These Cookies are used to remember your preferences on our
      Website and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information
      collected by these Cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify
      you personally. Functional Cookies do not track your internet usage or
      gather information which could be used for selling advertising.
      <i>Examples of how we may use functional Cookies include:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gathering data about visits to our Website, including numbers of
          visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked
          on or where visitors have come from.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login
          details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Analytical Performance: Analytical performance Cookies are used to monitor
      the performance of our Sites, for example, to determine the number of page
      views and the number of unique users our Website has. We use this
      information to improve user experience or identify areas of the Website
      which may require maintenance. The information is anonymous (i.e. it
      cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information
      such as your name and email address) and it is only used for statistical
      purposes.
      <i>Examples of how we may use analytical Cookies include:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>Measuring users’ behavior</li>
        <li>
          Analyze which pages are viewed and how long for and which links are
          followed to better develop our Website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Advertising: Behavioral advertising Cookies, which may be placed on your
      device by us or our trusted third-party service providers, remember that
      you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with
      advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called
      online behavioral advertising and is done by grouping together shared
      interests based upon web browsing history. Your web browsing history can
      be used to infer things about you (e.g. your age, gender etc.), and this
      information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant
      to you. Although behavioral advertising Cookies can track your activity
      around the internet, these Cookies cannot identify you personally, even if
      you are signed in to our Website.
      <i>Examples of how we may use advertising Cookies include:</i>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Manage online advertising. Our approved advertising partners use
          Cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you and to
          enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for
          example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular
          advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement.
        </li>
        <li>
          To market to specific users across our Website and third party sites,
          so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will
          be more relevant to users’ interests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <i>Third Party Cookies:</i> You may notice on some pages of our Website
      that Cookies have been set that are not related to us. When you visit a
      page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these
      third party service providers may set their own Cookies on your device. We
      do not control the use of these third party Cookies and cannot access them
      due to the way that Cookies work, as Cookies can only be accessed by the
      party who originally set them. Please check the third-party websites for
      more information about these Cookies.
      <h5>HOW CAN YOU MANAGE OR OPT OUT OF COOKIES?</h5>
      Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from
      your hard drive. You can also change the preferences/settings in your web
      browser to control Cookies. In some cases, you can choose to accept
      Cookies from the primary site, but block them from third parties. In
      others, you can block Cookies from specific advertisers, or clear out all
      Cookies. Deleting or blocking Cookies may reduce functionality of the
      Website. To learn more about how to reject Cookies, visit

      <h3>RIGHTS RELATED TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
      Under laws in certain countries in which we operate, customers and other

      Data that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. We will, upon request,

      request, we will take reasonable steps to correct, amend, or delete your
      Personal Data that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in a
      manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law, except
      where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate
      to the risks to your privacy, where the rights of persons other than you
      would be violated or where doing so is otherwise consistent with
      applicable law. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right
      to charge a reasonable fee to cover costs for providing copies of Personal
      Information that you request. Please note that while any amendments,
      corrections or deletions will be reflected in active user databases (as

      disclosed some of your Personal Data to third parties, we cannot access
      that Personal Data any longer and cannot force the deletion or
      modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made
      those disclosures. We may retain your Personal Data to comply with laws,
      prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
      investigations, enforce our contracts, and take other actions otherwise
      permitted by law. Please contact us at ktestone85@gmail.com to submit a
